# patent_cards

This is the data, code and result for the paper "Multimodal LLM-assisted information extraction from historical documents: the case of Swedish patent cards (1945-1975) and ChatGPT" submitted to DHNB2025.

The sample cards are in the sample folder.
The mllm_card_result is the result generated by the multimodal large language model, GPT-4o and the gt_card_result is the data after human revision.

The script "gpt_card_rec_with_bacth" can be run with your api key for OpenAI. However, the result may slightly differ from the output file here, as the model generated individual responses each time follwing the prompt. The version of GPT-4o model used in our case study is gpt-4o-2024-08-06.
